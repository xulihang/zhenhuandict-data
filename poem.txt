Each year and every year, the blossoms return anew. Each year and every year, the bloom of youth does not. 年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同
to capture the heart of my fated lover and cling together till our hair turns gray. 愿得一人心，白首不分离。
A jade vessel is the symbol of a pure heart. 一片冰心在玉壶
The clothing compeletes the person 先敬罗衣后敬人
Beauties of slim waist in the Chu palace are quite graceful and charming. But their youth and beauty will fade away with the years. 嬛嬛一袅楚宫腰，那更春来香减玉消。
They would rather die on the branch retaining their scent than be scattered on the cold wind. 宁可枝头抱香死,不曾吹落北风中。
Green shoots spring from the shoal, and still I an far from home. 满汀芳草不成归
Raindrops fall on Dongting Lake. Fog shrouds the Imperial Mausoleum. I await my husband, but he has not arrived. The ripples in the lake are not- 雨潇潇兮洞庭，烟霏霏兮黄陵，望夫君兮不来，波渺渺而难升。
Consort Xiang's Complaint 湘妃怨
It's clear that the song is full of worry and sorrow. As if to complain that her lover has not yet returned. 分明曲里愁云雨，似道萧萧郎不归。
I've grow careworn for thinking of my lover. 为伊消得人憔悴
