the whole family could rise up through one's success 鸡犬升天
much changes over time 变化无常
be kind and generous 宽宏大量
be granted an ordinary life when one can live an extraordinary one. 明珠暗投
make a display of one's eloquence 能说会道
know how to show gratitute 知恩图报
beauty of the nation 国色天香
clever toungues 口齿伶俐的人
swagger around 耀武扬威
receive more than I can repay 无以为报
vivid 栩栩如生
It is better to accept deferentially than to decline courteously. 恭敬不如从命
A fault confessed is half redressed 知错能改 善莫大焉
be torn in dilemma 进退两难
make up for mistake 将功折罪
Even if I wanted to do something, I'm unable to do anything about it. 心有余而力不足
begrudge oneself 妄自菲薄
Birth is much but breeding is more 英雄不问出身
